                        <h2 class="section-heading">Music And Art</h2>
                        <p>I began doing art and music before I could talk. My Mom never let me watch TV or play with Barbies. Everytime I had some playtime I was drawing in my room with music on in the background. At age 6, I began to take violin lessons. A few years later piano lessons were added to the mix. As I progressed on both instruments, I found it easier to learn others. </p>
                        <p>I took a few art classes when I was young, but I mostly just always had an interest in art. I was put in accelerated programs in 2nd grade that allowed my creativity to grow extremely quickly. Once I reached Middle School and High School art was just something that made me me. </p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/mosaic.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">Cambria working on a mixed media piece of mirror and stain glass mosaic.</span>
                        <p>I participated in several orchestra groups, including one that was awarded Best In State for Utah. Going into my senior year of High School, due to injury, it became too painful to pick up the violin or hold my arms for piano.</p>
                        <p>This is when my skills in art began to expand and progress. I took several Advanced Placement art classes. My school schedule was just a majority art and creative writing classes. One of my favorite mediums to explore was stained glass and mosaics.</p>
                        <p>Art and Music have always grounded me and helped me feel the most like myself. Today, I still take art classes at the university level and enjoy lots of painting and pen art. And, of course, I always have my AirPods in; jamming to my favorite tunes.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Hiking</h2>
                        <p>I was blessed to grow up in an extremely active family. A family full of runners. A family who chose to live right next to the mountains. Most of my childhood memories include camping and hiking!</p>
                        <p>As I grew up, hiking became less about just going because my parents were taking us and all about going because I really wanted to. My parents have given me and my sibilings so many opportunities to hike all over the world. You can visit my "Travel" page for more details! </p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/hiking.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">Cambria hiking in the Italian Alps, July 2022.</span>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">The Alps are the youngest mountain range in Europe, having formed approximately 65 million years ago. As well as mountains, the Alps are famous for it's clear Alpine lakes, including the stunning Lake Geneva, Lake Constance and Lake Como.</blockquote>
                        <p>Hiking will be a lifelong love of mine. I hope my body stays healthy as long as possible so that I can continue to do what I love. Breathing in the fresh mountain air is good my soul. </p>
                       
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Rock Climbing</h2>
                        <p>For some reason, I have always loved heights. They wake me up and make me feel alive. One of my favorite things is to get to the top of a mountain or sit on a cliff and just enjoy right where I am at. So when I first went rock climbing, I fell in love. Something about the ropes and the harness. I love rapelling, ziplining, climbing, mountaineering, you name it. </p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/climbing.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">Cambria rock climbing in Rock Canyon doing a route called "Curious George."</span>
                        <p>Everyday of High School I was at the boudlering gym. In the summers I found myself outdoor climbing more and more. This year I got to go almost every weekend and it was incredible. </p>
                        <p>Near the end of the season, there was a rock slide caused by some climbers on the pitch above. A rock the size of my head fell down and my instinct was to cover my head with my arms. One rock hit my arm and broke it. If my arm had not been in the way, I likely would have died. The fun part about this story is that I did not realize my arm was broken for a few days. So in the meantime I went and partied all night. Don't worry; I still love climbing!</p>
